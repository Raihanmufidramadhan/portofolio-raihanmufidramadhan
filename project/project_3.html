        <p>
          This project focuses on designing and developing a complete UI/UX system for a mobile
          application. The workflow includes user research, wireframing, prototyping, high-fidelity
          visual design, usability testing, and frontend implementation. The final mobile app is
          already functional and matches the approved design specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and ease of use, ensuring smooth navigation and
          a consistent experience across all screens.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            1. User Research & Needs Identification
          </h2>

          <!-- IMAGE FIRST -->
          <img

            alt="User Research"
            class="w-full max-w-4xl h-72 object-cover rounded-xl border border-gray-700 shadow-md mx-auto mb-6"
          />

          <!-- DESC AFTER -->
          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            The initial phase involved conducting user research to understand needs, motivations,
            and pain points. Surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis were performed to create
            user personas and define the primary user journey. The insights gathered guided the app's
            direction and ensured every feature would address real-life user problems effectively.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 2 -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            2. Wireframes & User Flow Mapping
          </h2>

          <img

            alt="Wireframe Design"
            class="w-full max-w-4xl h-72 object-cover rounded-xl border border-gray-700 shadow-md mx-auto mb-6"
          />

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Low-fidelity wireframes were created to outline the structure and navigation flow of the
            application. This stage focused on determining content placement, interaction patterns,
            and screen-to-screen logic. Wireframes served as the blueprint for both the visual design
            and development process, ensuring functional clarity before moving into detailed UI work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 3 -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            3. High-Fidelity UI Design & Visual System
          </h2>

          />

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            With the wireframes approved, I developed high-fidelity UI screens by applying the finalized
            color palette, typography, spacing system, iconography, and UI components. This stage
            establishes the brand identity of the app while maintaining consistency across all visual
            elements. Each screen was polished to deliver a clean and modern aesthetic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 4 -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            4. Prototyping & Usability Testing
          </h2>

          <img

          />

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            A clickable prototype was developed to simulate real interactions within the app. Usability
            tests were performed to identify navigation issues, visual inconsistencies, and potential
            confusion points. Iterations were made based on user feedback to improve clarity, simplify
            flows, and enhance overall usability.

        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          From early research to full mobile implementation, the project successfully delivers a
          modern, intuitive, and seamless user experience. The app is now fully operational and 
          accurately represents the design vision established during the UI/UX process.

          This project focuses on designing and developing a complete <span class="font-semibold text-emerald-400">UI/UX system for a mobile application</span>. 
          The workflow includes user research, wireframing, prototyping, high-fidelity visual design, usability testing, and frontend implementation. 
          The final app is fully functional and aligns perfectly with the approved design specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emphasis was placed on simplicity, clarity, and intuitive navigation, ensuring a consistent and smooth experience across all screens, providing users with a seamless interaction.

      <!-- Development Steps -->
      <section class="space-y-20">

        <!-- STEP 1: User Research -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-xl border border-gray-700">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            1. User Research & Needs Identification
          </h2>

          <div class="w-full flex justify-center mb-6">
            <img
              src="../gambar/gambar_17.jpg"
              alt="User Research"
              class="w-full max-w-4xl h-72 object-cover rounded-xl border border-gray-700 shadow-md"
            />
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            The initial phase involved conducting comprehensive user research to understand the target audience, their needs, motivations, and pain points. 
            Surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis were performed to create detailed user personas, helping to define the primary user journey and identify critical features. 
            The insights guided the app’s overall direction, ensuring each functionality effectively solves real-life user problems.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 2: Wireframes -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-xl border border-gray-700">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            2. Wireframes & User Flow Mapping
          </h2>

          <div class="w-full flex justify-center mb-6">
            <img
              src="../gambar/gambar_16.png"
              alt="Wireframe Design"
              class="w-full max-w-4xl h-72 object-cover rounded-xl border border-gray-700 shadow-md"
            />
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            Low-fidelity wireframes were created to map the structure, content layout, and screen-to-screen navigation of the app. 
            This stage determined the hierarchy of elements, interaction patterns, and logical flows between pages. 
            Wireframes acted as the blueprint for both visual design and development, ensuring clarity and usability before progressing to high-fidelity screens.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 3: High-Fidelity UI -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-xl border border-gray-700">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            3. High-Fidelity UI Design & Visual System
          </h2>

            />
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            After wireframe approval, high-fidelity UI screens were created using the finalized color palette, typography, iconography, and spacing system. 
            Components and interactions were designed consistently across all screens to reflect brand identity and ensure a polished, modern look. 
            Each screen was refined to balance aesthetics with usability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- STEP 4: Prototyping -->
        <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-xl border border-gray-700">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-6">
            4. Prototyping & Usability Testing
          </h2>

          <div class="w-full flex justify-center mb-6">
            <img

            />
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            A clickable prototype was developed to simulate real user interactions. 
            Usability tests were conducted to detect navigation issues, inconsistencies, and points of confusion. 
            Based on feedback, iterations were made to improve flows, enhance clarity, and optimize the overall user experience.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          From user research to fully functional implementation, the project successfully delivers a modern, intuitive, and seamless mobile experience.

          This project is a fully custom-built cooperative website called
          <span class="text-emerald-400 font-semibold">"Tabungan Kita Bersama"</span>, 
          designed to provide seamless digital savings and loan services to members. 
          The development encompassed the entire workflow from conceptualization, 
          visual design, frontend development, to backend integration, ensuring 
          a fully functional and responsive web platform.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Key technologies included <b>HTML</b>, <b>Tailwind CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> 
          for the responsive frontend, and <b>PHP</b> with <b>MySQL</b> for backend logic and data management, 
          providing a reliable, secure, and scalable system.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400">1. Wireframe & Layout Planning</h2>
          <p class="mt-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            The project began with a comprehensive analysis of user needs and system requirements. 
            I sketched low-fidelity wireframes to visualize page structures, navigation flows, 
            and placement of essential UI components. Iterative feedback from stakeholders was incorporated 
            to refine the hierarchy and interaction patterns, ensuring clarity and usability. 
            This process established a strong foundation for visual design and frontend development.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400">2. Visual Design & UI Creation</h2>
          <p class="mt-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            After wireframes were finalized, I crafted the visual design, focusing on brand-aligned color schemes, typography, icons, and overall aesthetics. 
            Each page component was designed to enhance usability while maintaining a modern, cohesive look. 
            Interactive elements and UI patterns were carefully planned to ensure intuitive user experiences across different devices.

        <!-- Step 3: Frontend Development -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400">3. Frontend Development</h2>
          <p class="mt-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            I translated the visual designs into a fully responsive frontend using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. 
            Components were built with reusability in mind, while responsiveness ensured consistent user experiences on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. 
            I also implemented client-side validations, dynamic interactions, and animations to enhance usability and visual appeal.

        <!-- Step 4: Backend Development -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400">4. Backend Integration & Data Management</h2>
          <p class="mt-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-justify">
            The backend was developed using PHP to handle form submissions, data validation, processing logic, and secure interactions with the MySQL database. 
            I designed tables, relationships, and queries to support efficient data retrieval and manipulation. 
            Security measures were implemented to protect user data and ensure transactional integrity. 
            The backend seamlessly integrated with the frontend to deliver a reliable end-to-end system.
